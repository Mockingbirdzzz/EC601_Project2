# EC601_Project2

Hi professor,

  My application for the access of Twitter API was rejected for some reasons, even though I indicated that it was only for academic uses and stuff. Therefore I have to start this project with Google NLP API first. Currently, the Google NLP is trainning my model and it'll be finished in several hours. Further output from my model will be posted in this repository soon. Thanks!
